# ProcessControlProject
This project uses a root solver to find complex roots and create a root locus plot in order to determine what values the controller will be stable at. A bode stability analysis is also done using Matplotlib to determine stability. 

Before You Run:
1. This project has two files, a .ipynb file and .py file. Choose either file to run. I suggest running through Juypter using .ipynb file since the code is already sectioned.
2. The required modules are sympy and matplotlib


How To Run Through Juypter Notebook:
1. Run through all code cells of the .ipynb file

How To Run The .py file:
1. Run the script
