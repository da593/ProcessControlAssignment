# ProcessControlAssignment
This assignment uses a root solver to find complex roots and to create a root locus plot in order to determine what values the controller will be stable at. A bode stability analysis is also done using Matplotlib to determine stability. 

Before You Run:
1. This project has two files, a .ipynb file and .py file. Choose either file to run. The code is originally written and ran through the .ipynb file.
2. The required modules are sympy and matplotlib


How To Run the .ipynb file:
1. Requires Juypter Notebook to run the .ipynb file. Anaconda program includes Juypter Notebook.
1. Run through all code cells of the .ipynb file 

How To Run The .py file:
1. Run the script through a Python IDE (Pycharm, Thonny, etc.)
