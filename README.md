# ProcessControlProject
This project uses a root solver to find complex roots and create a root locus plot in order to determine what values the controller will be stable at. A bode stability analysis is also done using Matplotlib to determine stability. 

BEFORE YOU RUN:
1.This project has two files, a .ipynb file and .py file
2.In order to run the .ipynb file, it must be ran through Juypter Notebook, which is included with Anaconda
3. The .py file can be ran through any typical Python IDE.
4. The required modules are sympy and matplotlib
5. I suggest running through Juypter using .ipynb file since the code is already sectioned.

How To Run Through Juypter Notebook:
1. Run through all code cells

How To Run Through Python File:
1. Run the script
